# Public API Data Viewer (e.g., Weather):

# Python: Uses the requests library to consume a free public API 
# (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, CoinGecko) and process the returned JSON 
# data.

# Front-end: Displays the data in a user-friendly way 
# (e.g., current temperature, humidity, and a weather icon for a 
# city).
