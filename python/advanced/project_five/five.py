# Kanban Board (Trello Style):

# Python/DB: Manages task "cards" and "columns" (To Do, In Progress, 
# Done). The key feature is allowing users to drag and drop the 
# cards between columns.

# Front-end: Intensive use of JavaScript to implement the Drag and 
# Drop functionality and send dynamic updates via AJAX or API to 
# the Python back-end.
