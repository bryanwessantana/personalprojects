📊 CSV File Data Viewer

This project is excellent for learning file handling in Python and 
how to structure simple, tabular data for the web. You'll use a 
built-in Python library to process the file.

Key Components
- Python/Flask:
    - Use the built-in csv library to easily read the contents of 
    the file.
    - The Python code reads the CSV file, extracting the header 
    row (for table columns) and the data rows.
    - The data is structured (e.g., as a list of dictionaries) 
    so Flask can easily pass it to the template.
- HTML: 
    - A simple display page.
    - The core element is an HTML table (<table>) to display 
    the structured data, using a loop to iterate over the data rows.
- A Sample .csv File: You will need a simple, static file (e.g., 
data/countries.csv) with columns like Country, Capital, Population.

Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Create Static Data: Place a small .csv file in a dedicated 
folder (e.g., data/).
2. Define Route: Create a route (e.g., /csv_viewer) that triggers 
the file reading.
3. Read and Process:
    - Open the CSV file within the Python route.
    - Use csv.reader or csv.DictReader to parse the file.
    - Store the header names and the rows of data in variables.
4. Render Table: Render a template (viewer.html), passing the 
headers and the data rows. The HTML template then uses a loop to 
create the table structure: a <thead> for headers and a <tbody> with 
nested loops for the rows and cells.
