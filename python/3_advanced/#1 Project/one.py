# Real-Time Chat Application:

# Python/Async: Requires the use of technologies like WebSockets 
# (e.g., Flask-SocketIO or Django Channels) to allow messages to be 
# sent and received instantly without reloading the page.

# Front-end: Interactive chat interface that uses JavaScript to 
# display new messages dynamically.
