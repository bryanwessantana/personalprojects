🧑‍⚕️ 🔄 Basic Unit Converter

This project focuses on logic branching (if/elif/else statements) 
to handle different conversion types and data validation to ensure 
the user inputs numbers.

Key Components
- Python/Flask:
    - One route (/) to display the form.
    - The conversion logic: The Python function will receive the 
    input value, the source unit, and the target unit. It then uses 
    conditional logic to perform the specific calculation 
    (e.g., if converting "km" to "miles," multiply by $0.621371$).
- HTML:
    - An input field for the value to be converted.
    - Two dropdown menus (<select>) for the user to choose the 
    source unit and the target unit (e.g., km, miles, C, F).
- CSS: Basic styling for clarity.

Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Define Conversions: In your app.py, define the conversion factors. 
A dictionary structure can be useful here to map units 
(e.g., CONVERSIONS = {'km_to_mi': 0.621371, 
'c_to_f_multiplier': 1.8, ...}).
2. Setup the Form: Create a template (converter.html) with the input 
field and the unit selection dropdowns.
3. Handle POST: The route receiving the form data validates that the 
value is a number and checks which conversion was selected 
(e.g., if source_unit == 'km' and target_unit == 'miles':).
4. Calculate & Display: Perform the calculation and render the 
template again, passing the original value, units, and the calculated 
result to the page.
