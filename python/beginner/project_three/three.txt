📝 In-Memory To-Do List

This project is crucial for understanding how to manage state on the 
server side without a database, and how to handle multiple actions 
(Add, Delete) using forms that post data back to Python.

Key Components
- Python/Flask:
    - Use a global Python list (e.g., tasks = []) to store the to-do items.
    - The main route will handle both displaying the list and receiving new 
    tasks (POST).
    - Logic to append a new item to the list.
    - Logic to remove an item (usually by its index/ID passed via the form).
- HTML: 
    - A form to input a new task.
    - An unordered or ordered list (<ul> or <ol>) to display the current tasks.
    - For each task, include a small form with a 'Delete' button that sends 
    the task's ID/index back to the server.
- CSS: Simple layout to make the tasks readable.

Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Initialize List: Define an empty list tasks = [] in your app.py.
2. Display Logic: The main route renders the template, passing the tasks list. 
The template iterates over this list, displaying each task and its 
corresponding delete button/form.
3. Add Task: The POST request receives the new task text, appends it to the 
global tasks list, and then redirects back to the main route to show 
the updated list.
4. Delete Task: The POST request for deletion receives the index of the task 
to be deleted. Use the Python list's pop() method to remove the item 
at that index. Then, redirect back to the main route.
