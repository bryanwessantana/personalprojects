🔐 Simple Password Generator

This project teaches you how to use Python libraries for random 
generation and how to pass complex data (the generated password 
string) back to the user.

Key Components
- Python/Flask:
    - Use the built-in Python library random to select characters.
    - The logic should take the desired length from the user and 
    generate a string containing a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
    - One route to display the form and a results area.
- HTML: An input field for the desired password length and a button 
to generate.
- JavaScript (Optional but Recommended): A small script to add a 
"Copy to Clipboard" button next to the generated password.

Suggested Implementation Steps
1. Setup the Form: Create a template with an input for length.
2. Define Characters: In Python, define strings for possible characters 
(e.g., lowercase = 'abcdefg...', digits = '0123...', etc.).
3. Generation Logic: Based on the user-provided length, randomly select 
characters from the combined character pool and join them to form 
the password string.
4. Display: Render the same template, passing the generated password 
string to be displayed clearly on the page.
